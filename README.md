1. All code written by me, Levin Rainey. Obviously I read and copied sections of the opencv-python (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) in doing so.
   
2. Setup requires:
        a) A directory titled `output_videos` to be created in the same directory as the program file.
        b) A directory titled `outputs` to be created in the `output_videos` directory.
        c) A directory titled `test_images` to be created in the same directory as the program file.

3. Clearly this setup is strange and irritating, but I'm uploading this program more to back it up for myself than for public use. If you want to change this directory system, see the following lines in the Python file: `24`, `63`.

4. Finally, you may notice that in the included pre-set-up directories here on GitHub, there contains a `.txt` file in both `outputs` and `test_images`. This was for me to create these directories on GitHub, as I did it via the website. Feel free to delete them after download, since they obviously provide no use to the program.
