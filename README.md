1. All code written by me, Levin Rainey. Obviously I read and copied sections of the opencv-python (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) in doing so.

        a) A directory titled `outputs` to be created in the same directory as the program file.
        b) A directory titled `test_images` to be created in the same directory as the program file.
